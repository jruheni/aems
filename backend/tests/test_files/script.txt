    The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell. It produces ATP through cellular respiration, which involves several steps including glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. The inner membrane of the mitochondria is folded into cristae to increase surface area for ATP production.
    
    Mitochondria have their own DNA (mtDNA) and can replicate independently of the cell cycle. They are believed to have originated from ancient bacteria through endosymbiosis. This theory suggests that mitochondria were once free-living bacteria that were engulfed by larger cells.
    
    The number of mitochondria in a cell varies depending on the cell's energy needs. Cells that require more energy, such as muscle cells, contain more mitochondria than cells with lower energy requirements.
    
    In addition to energy production, mitochondria also play roles in:
    1. Calcium signaling
    2. Cell death (apoptosis)
    3. Heat production
    4. Steroid hormone synthesis
    
    Mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, and aging.
